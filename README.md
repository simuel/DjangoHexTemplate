**DjangoHexTemplate** is a robust and scalable template for building Django applications using **Hexagonal Architecture** or **Clean Architecture** principles. This project structure encourages a separation of concerns, keeping your business logic independent from the framework and infrastructure details, thus promoting maintainability, testability, and adaptability over time.

## Features

- **Domain-Driven Design:** Clear separation of business logic from infrastructure.
- **Hexagonal/Clean Architecture:** Organized into domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers.
- **Testability:** Easy to write unit and integration tests for each layer.
- **Extensibility:** Can be easily extended to fit various use cases and business requirements.
- **Django REST Framework Integration:** Preconfigured serializers for API development.

## Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the project's main directories and their purpose:
```plaintext
DjangoHexTemplate/
|-- app_name/                   # Main directory for the application
|   |-- domain/                 # Core business logic and entities
|   |-- application/            # Use cases and application logic
|   |-- infrastructure/         # Infrastructure details (DB, serializers)
|   |-- presentation/           # User interface and API endpoints
|   |-- tests/                  # Unit and integration tests
|-- README.md                   # Project documentation
```
## Prerequisites
